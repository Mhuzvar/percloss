    "# An Overview of Perceptually Relevant Metrics of Audio Similarity for Potential Use as Loss In Training Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several areas that need thorough exploration:\n",
    "- conventional loss functions\n",
    "   - equipped with some modification to improve their perceptual relevance\n",
    "   - like pre-emphasis\n",
    "- complex perception focused metrics\n",
    "   - mostly focused on quality assessment\n",
    "   - may need some modification as well\n",
    "- trained models\n",
    "   - least \"safe\" method but likely best performing *as long as the inputs are similar to training dataset*\n",
    "\n",
    "General notes from the literature:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Amos Tversky researched similarity, perception, and categorization from psychology point of view. He noted human perception does not satisfy the definition of a euclidean metric [1](#references).\n",
    "- Large portion of \"music similarity\" research focuses on clustering music with the aim of content delivery optimization [1](#references).\n",
    "- MFCC based distance may be helpful [1](#references) (not directly mentioned) and there should be a way to make mel-cepstral distance differentiable [2](#references).\n",
